Bongo Cat in Rainmeter.

The skin uses `Bitmap` meter because of it's tilemap feature, an arguably stupid choice as you can't change the size through Rainmeter, but need to change the image file dimmensions themselves; the `X` position also isn't relative. The skin also uses `AudioLevel` `RMS` for left and right audio.

Project is abandoned.
